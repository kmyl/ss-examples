`nodemon app.js -e "js coffee"`

I'm using this for SocketStream development also, so you may not see the SocketStream dependency in the package.json file.

#### SocketStream, CoffeeScript and React demo

###### goals :

The mvp goals are just to show a way to get React working nicely with SocketStream, and have some fun and experimentation with various UI development stuff. That is done.  A further-along goal kind of in incubation now is to develop an entertaining example app, will have to conceive and design it first.  

###### Please note:
_(This demo uses a (**derivative**) of a style React+CoffeeScript I learned from Alberto Torres Ruiz. This is not the only way of using React + CoffeeScript with SocketStream -- I or others may document other ways in the future. This is a nice way of doing it though.)_

##### todo:

- make a real chat demo app here

- write a webpack bundler for nirvana require for the libs
