`nodemon app.js -e "js coffee"`

I'm using this for SocketStream development also, so you may not see the SocketStream dependency in the package.json file.

#### SocketStream, CoffeeScript and React demo

###### goals :

The mvp goals are just to show a way to get React working nicely with SocketStream, and have some fun and experimentation with various UI development stuff. That is done, and since then I've just been using it to test various things out, and also for SocketStream development testing.
A further-along goal kind of in incubation now is to develop an entertaining example app, will have to conceive and design it first.  Chat apps are kind of like to-do apps now, so I'm thinking of something different, something maybe allowing one client to run commands on the other client's browser tab (permissioned and signaled).  Or something else that may come to mind.

###### Please note:
_(This demo uses a (**derivative**) of a style React+CoffeeScript I learned from Alberto Torres Ruiz. This is not the only way of using React + CoffeeScript with SocketStream -- I or others may document other ways in the future. This is a nice way of doing it though.)_
